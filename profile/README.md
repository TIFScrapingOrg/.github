# Improving Chicago’s Fiscal Transparency By Extracting Historical Financial Data Through a Machine Learning Pipeline

> Since 1986, approximately $25 billion dollars of property tax revenue collected from Chicago property owners has been diverted into Chicago's district-based Tax Increment Financing (TIF) program [[1]](https://tifreports.com/illinois-illumination). TIFs currently cover roughly 33% of the area, mi^2, in the City of Chicago [[2]](https://chicagopolicyreview.org/2023/04/13/redevelopment-for-who-how-tif-redistributes-public-funds-to-the-wealthy/). Transparency is imperative for good governance and civic involvement in decisions regarding the TIF funds considering their property taxes could be used towards potential projects which provide little community support. The lack of data has caused TIFs to face scrutiny over concerns regarding the [transparency of investment allocation](https://socialistworker.org/2017/07/27/protesting-another-tif-theft-in-chicago). Prior to 2010, TIF district data had been archived using digital scans rather than direct computer entry, reducing accessibility for analytical purposes. Although an [existing dataset](https://github.com/philipayates/chicago2022TIF) has been made by [Phillip Yates](https://github.com/philipayates). Our project outlines an algorithmic approach to extracting, organizing, and hosting Chicago TIF records dating back to 1997. We developed an automated “document to data” pipeline by leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Machine Learning (ML), and parsing algorithms technologies to perform direct data extraction from the scanned documents. We are currently hosting the existing Chicago TIF data via AWS RDS, allowing for seamlessly integrating newly extracted data, ensuring comprehensive and up-to-date records. Through this work, we hope to improve transparency, accountability, and informed civic engagement in Chicago, thereby supporting equitable urban growth.
